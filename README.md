### In the game named "Space Fighter" you can express yourself like a space explorer that was trapped in an asteroid belt. Your goal is to prevent breaking down your ship from asteroids by dodging or shooting them. 

Instruction:

- There are three levels you can choose based on your preferences for complexity:
  - first level is the easiest;
  - second – normal;
  - third – BOSS-level – is the most complicated. You barely manage to kill the BOSS.

- At the start screen by tapping the button "Manual", you can be introduced with rules of the game
- At the beginning, you have 3 lives, which one erases of, when you're damaged by alien. You lose, when you're out of lives. You win, when you kill all the aliens. 
- When the game is over, you can see your score and leave the game.
