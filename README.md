### In the game named "Space Fighter" you can express yourself like a space explorer that was trapped by dangerous aliens. Your goal is to prevent breaking down your ship from them by dodging their laser-bullets or shooting their ships. 

Instruction:

- There are three levels you can choose based on your preferences for complexity:
  - first level is the easiest;
  - second – normal;
  - third – BOSS-level – is the most complicated. You barely manage to kill the BOSS because he is regularly reinforced by two alien's ships. By the way, be aware, you have the only life!

- At the start screen by tapping the button "Manual", you can be introduced with rules of the game;
- At the same window ("Manual") you can download more detailed instruction selecting necessary path for saving the file;
- At the beginning, you have 3 lives, which one erases of, when you're damaged by alien. You lose, when you're out of lives. You win, when you kill all the aliens;
- When the game is over, you can return to the main screen by pressing any button;
- If you want to leave the game, you can press "Quit" on the main screen or click the cross at the top of the game-screen.
