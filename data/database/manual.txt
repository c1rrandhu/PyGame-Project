Instruction:

1) There are three levels you can choose based on your preferences for complexity:
    - first level is the easiest;
    - second – normal;
    - third – BOSS-level – is the most complicated. You barely manage to kill the BOSS because he is regularly reinforced by two alien's ships. By the way, be aware, you have the only life!
2) At the start screen by tapping the button "Manual", you can be introduced with rules of the game;
3) At the beginning, you have 3 lives, which one erases of, when you're damaged by alien. You lose, when you're out of lives. You win, when you kill all the aliens;
4) When the game is over, you can return to the main screen by pressing any button;
5) If you want to leave the game, you can press "Quit" on the main screen or click the cross at the top of the game-screen.
